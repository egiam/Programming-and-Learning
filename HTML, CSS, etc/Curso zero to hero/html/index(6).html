        It is an essential source of renewable energy,
        and its technologies are broadly
        characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on how they
        capture and distribute solar energy or convert it into solar power.
        Active solar techniques include the use of photovoltaic systems,
        concentrated solar power, and solar water heating to harness the energy.
        Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun,
        selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or
        light-dispersing properties,
        and designing spaces that naturally circulate air.
        The large magnitude of solar energy available makes it a highly
        appealing source of electricity.
